# Nvim
My config is going through a transtion period right now. I have chosed to 
rewrite it recently but have not devoted long stretches to it (ussually just 
changing whatever is pressing). I am trying to remove almost everything to 
get it to a few very small files that are easy to understand and modify. I
but I am a horder so i comment out code instead of deleting it. It will take
time.
